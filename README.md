## OPTICODE: A DYNAMIC LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR PROGRAMMING PROFICIENCY USING RAG AND LLM MODELS 
### ABSTRACT 

The OptiCode system transforms programming education using a blend of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques. Users choose a programming language and title, prompting the RAG model to generate a code template with blank spaces. Users fill in logic-based code snippets, engaging in the coding process. The RAG model retrieves relevant code snippets, seamlessly combined with LLM for correctness, best practices, and optimization. The LLM analyzes user code, providing feedback on correctness and efficiency. A comprehensive analysis report guides users to refine and optimize their code iteratively. OptiCode offers a dynamic, user-centric, and productive learning experience, leveraging cutting-edge NLP and code generation technologies.
